# repositories-api

A NodeJS API to management projects/repositories.

The main idea of this challenge is to refactor an application that is already developed and has integration tests tests it.

After some changes in the application code, part of the tests failed and now only you can solve this problem. Let's go there? üöÄ

This application performs CRUD (**C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, **D**elete) of project repositories. In addition, it is possible to give likes to registered repositories, increasing the number of likes by 1 each time the route is called.
